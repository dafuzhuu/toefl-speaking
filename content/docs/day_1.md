## Pracice 1

> Some people believe that television has a negative impact on children and should be avoided. Others feel that television is one of many ways a child can learn. Which do you believe?

如果问选 A 还是选 B，可以同时站在 A 和 B 的角度答，在没思路的情况下是可以这样做的

I believe that television can have both positive and negative effects on children, so it should not be fully avoided, but instead, managed correctly.

## Pracice 2    

> Children should help their parents with household chores when they are old enough to do so. Do you agree or disagree?

My idea:

1. they have to do household chores when they become adults
2. teach they about responsibility by contributing to the family

Tutor's answer:

I think is a great idea

1. the first thing is that, whenever you get older, you have to do these things around the house, so why not getting the practice when you're younger?
2. another reason is because, you know, it gives them to be together, the parents and children. I think this will help to improve your life skills

## Pracice 3

> Teacher should assign daily homework to students. Do you agree or disagree?

1. ss understand the subjects
2. t check what ss learned
3. help ss develop knowledge
4. plan future lectures

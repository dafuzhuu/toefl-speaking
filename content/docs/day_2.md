> Do you prefer write by hand or type on a computer?

对于prefer的问题，用比较级可以说的更流畅，比如我的回答中

After we have practiced using the keyboard, it will become very fast to ... eh ... type on a computer, and will save a lot of time

可以说

it will become faster comparing with writing on paper

Changes to Be Made in Tomorrow’s Elections

> All students should be aware that there are two changes in tomorrow’s student council elections. First of all, there will be no voting in the student library as the librarians have claimed that voting there would be too noisy. As a result, voting will only be permitted in the student center and at the student cafeteria. The second change concerns the student cafeteria. Voting there will end at 8 P.M. rather than at 9 P.M. since the cafeteria regularly closes at eight. Those students wishing to vote between eight and nine must do so at the student center.

The man expresses his opinion about the article in the school newspaper. Explain his opinion and the reasons he gives for holding that opinion.

这题被用来说明怎样读文段。先抓关键词，比如 first, second, 然后 as a result 这些表结果的先不看。这样就记录下三行笔记

1. Changes made in elections
2. no voting in lib, too noisy
3. voting at cafe ends at 8, vote at stu center if after 8

要用笔记下的部分就这些了

这时会疑惑，说完图书馆，怎么说到 cafe 了？这时再看先前跳过的部分，在 as a result 中解释了。我们搞明白了前因后果，as a result 并不是作为结果而是作为解释为什么提到 cafe 的原因

另外，忘记模板，回答问题。空隙用文章信息补充
